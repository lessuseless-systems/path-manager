# TODO: Implement perSystem integration for path-manager
#
# This module should provide flake-parts perSystem integration,
# allowing path-manager to be used in flake-parts-based configurations.
#
# Example structure:
# {
#   perSystem = { config, pkgs, ... }: {
#     # path-manager integration here
#   };
# }
#
# See: https://flake.parts/

{ ... }:

{
  # Placeholder for future flake-parts integration
}
